## why I need the repo regarding this course while taking it
* to further understand the concepts of LLM at the level where I can communicate with other experts with minimal searching
* to be able to create my own projects regarding gen AI with LLMs
* to be better prepared as a data scientist/consultant who should be able to explain notions that will be addressed in the lecture

## what to write here
* my own understsanding without any mindless copying & pasting
* further studies by myself
* codes I wrote 

## when/what to write
* after watching a video, I will write what I understood without consulting any lecture materials but only my own notebooks
* after a week, I will write on the overall subject matters, the key concepts, and my review 
* after the whole course, I will fine-tune the stuff I wrote down consulting lecture materials and add visualizations, enriching the contents

## how to write them
* not just in a matter-of-fact style but in a way that provokes thoughts, motivating me to go deeper into the subject matters, not hiding curiosity
