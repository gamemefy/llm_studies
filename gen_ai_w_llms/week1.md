# Introduction to LLMs and the generative AI project lifecycle

## Generative AI & LLMs
* we call LLM models such as GPT a base model. apparently it is one of the biggest but it doesn't seem the biggest
* we interact differently with LLM models compared to other machine learning models. they take natural language in a prompt window and the result is also in natural language
  
## LLM use cases and tasks
* areas of usage: text analysis, translation, coding, entity extraction(e.g. getting names of people), etc.

## Text generation before transformers
* transformers beat RNNs since it got introduced in 2017, allowing complex languages to be understandable to the machines with other benefits such as:
  * scale efficiently
  * put meanings of the words into consideration
  * make use of parallel processing, utilizing big data
